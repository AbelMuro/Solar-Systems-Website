                    Behold, the biggest planet in our solar system, Jupiter. 
                    This planet is believed to have no solid surface and is 
                    made up entirely of gas and liquid metallic hydrogen.
                    Jupiter is also the fourth brightest object in our solar 
                    system. It's so bright that its actually visible through 
                    the naked eye. The planet has constant storms that are raging 
                    throughout. The most notable storm is known as the Great Red Spot.
                    Scientists believe that this particular storm has been raging 
                    for at least 186 years. Other estimates point to this storm raging
                    for about three and a half centuries. <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    This planet has actually helped us out by deflecting comets and 
                    asteroids that could potentially strike earth and cause potential 
                    damage. Although this planet could have possibly saved millions of lives,
                    Jupiter does not have a conducive enviroment for supporting any type 
                    of life form on it.

                    The name Jupiter was named after the Roman god equivalent of Zeus.
                    Originally the name was actually Jove, instead of Jupiter. The Romans 
                    first identified Jupiter when they first observed seven bright objects
                    that were visible through the naked eye. They Romans decided to name these
                    objects after their most powerful gods. Jupiter was known to be the most powerful
                    god in Roman mythology. Jupiter is the god of the sky and king of the gods.

                    Considering that the planet is the most massive in our
                    solar system, the core of Jupiter is extremely pressurized.
                    This in turn makes the core extremely hot. Scientists estimate
                    that the planet is approximately 71% hydrogen, 24% helium, and 5% 
                    other elements by mass. It is also believed that the core is made up
                    of primarily iron, which is considered the heaviest element found in 
                    significant quantities in our solar system.<br><br>

                Jupiter will probably not be as pretty as this picture here,
                but it's a close representation. The planet has winds that can
                easily destroy any known life form. Jupiters gases are also toxic
                to us, so traveling to this planet might just be a pipe dream.
