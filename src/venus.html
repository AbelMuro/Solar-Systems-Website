                    This is Venus, a real hell on earth, literally.
                    This planet is known to be the hottest planet
                    in our solar system. The average temperature on
                    this planet is 864 degrees fahrenheit. The reason
                    this planet is hotter than mercury is because of its 
                    thick, dense cloud layer. Earth and Venus are very 
                    similar in size and mass, but the real difference lies 
                    in their atmosphere. The atmosphere on this planet is 
                    made up of mostly carbon dioxide with some traces of nitrogen 
                    <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Venus has a very small tilt compared to earth. Here on Earth,
                    the tilt is what gives us seasons, but on venus, there are 
                    literally no seasons at all. In other words, the planet has 
                    consistent temperatures all year round. The atmosphere in Venus 
                    is known to be toxic to any known lifeforms on earth. Even though
                    it may be unlikely that this planet may host life. Some scientists 
                    believe that there may be microbes that could exist high in the clouds 
                    where it's supposedly cooler.

                    The name Venus was named after one of the Roman Gods, more specifically, 
                    the Roman Goddess of Love. The planet's symbol is the symbol for womanhood 
                    and love. This planet is especially bright on Earths sky because the clouds on
                    Venus do a much better job at reflecting light.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    The core on Venus is a bit difficult to study because the entire
                    planet is shrouded in a very thick atmosphere. So our telescopes 
                    can only see so much from down here on Earth. However, scientists 
                    have made steady progress in understanding the core of this planet.
                    It is believed that the planet has a iron core that is similar to 
                    Earth's. The core is enveloped by a hot-rock mantle and has a very
                    thin crust that surrounds the entire planet.

                This place is a true representation of hell,
                as stated before, the planet has constant temperatures
                all year long. It is believed that even the clouds in venus 
                are made of sulfuric acid. Volcanos are scattered all around
                the surface of the planet shooting up lava in all directions.
                Not a good place to take a vacation.
