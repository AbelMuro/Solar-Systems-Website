                    This is Earth, the only known planet to host life.
                    It is the biggest terrestial planet in our solar system.
                    This planet is made up of around 70% water, but surpisingly
                    enough, the water only accounts to less than 1% of Earths mass.
                    It's quite the planet isn't it? It's our home but there are still
                    so much left unexplored in our own planet. Our planet has a very strong
                    magnetic field due to the presence of inner Nickel-iron core. It is 
                    because of this magnetic field that we are protected from the sun's solar 
                    winds, which can cause alot of damage to the different life forms that we
                    have here. <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    It is also surpising to note that 99% of all species that ever existed on 
                    earth are now extict. Keep in mind that earth has lived for over 4 billion years.
                    This is plenty of time for thousands of species to appear and disappear.
                    Compared to the planet, we humans are a relatively young species. We only came into
                    existence about 1 to 2.5 million years ago. We are certainly a young, ambitious group of 
                    species aren't we? This is our home and we should consider taking care of it.

                    Earth is the only planet in our solar system that was not named after a Roman God.
                    The name itself was derived from the english and german words 'ertha' and 'erde'
                    respectively. Earth literally means ground. The name is estimated to be around 1000
                    years old.

                    As you would expect, the earths core is an extremely dense and extremely hot
                    area of our planet. This core lies deep within our cool, brittle crust and solid 
                    mantle. The core can be found 1,802 miles from the surface of the earth.

                Beautiful isn't it? Earth could be the envy of alien civilizations.
                We have forests that are enormous, cities that showcase our technologies,
                oceans that are insanely deep and have mysteries that have yet to be
                discovered.
