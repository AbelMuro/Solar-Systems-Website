                    This is Mars, the second smallest planet in our Solar System
                    and the fourth planet from our Sun. This planet is also
                    referred to as the Red planet because of its appearance. The red
                    color comes from the high content of iron oxide that the planet has.
                    The atmosphere on Mars is very thin and has low atmospheric pressure on
                    its surface, which is the reason why liquid water cannot exist on its surface
                    for long. The planet also has 2 moon named Phobos and Deimos, these two moons are
                    small and irregularly shaped. <br><br>

                    Mars is the closest planet to us that has the potential to support life,
                    Scientists have found evidence that the planet once had water, which is 
                    the closest indicator that the planet could have hosted life thousands of
                    years ago. However, due to mysterious events, the planet as it is now may be 
                    uninhabitable to life as we know it. Mars is a very cold planet. The average
                    temperature on Mars stays around -80 degrees fahrenheit, which is below the
                    freezing point. The planet also has constant dust storms that engulf most of 
                    the planet at a single point in time.

                    The name Mars comes from the Roman God of War in mythology.
                    The romans identified seven bright objects in the sky; five bright planets,
                    the sun and the moon. The roman astronomers named these planets after Roman gods,
                    and Mars was among them.

                    Scientist have reason to believe that the core of Mars is much bigger
                    than we anticipated at first. NASA sent a satellite to mars, which landed
                    on the surface and studied the planet for an entire Martian year. It is because
                    of this satellite that scientists have a better understanding of the core of 
                    the planet. Scientists estimate that the core could range between 1,110 to 1,300
                    miles across.<br><br>

                Just look at this place, a barren red desert that can't sustain water,
                It's hard to believe that this planet once had water in its distant 
                past. As the planet is now, humans cannot survive in this cold wasteland..

                The temperatures of this planet fall far below 0 degrees farhenheit. Even 
                during the day time, the planet has freezing temperatures. But it's even 
                worse at night. Click the button below to see how Mars looks like at night<br><br>
