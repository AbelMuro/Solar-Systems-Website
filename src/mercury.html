                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Mercury, the closest planet to the sun. 
                    It's quite the planet,  the sun would appear about 3 times larger 
                    than what we see on earth.The temperatures on this planet can range between 
                    <b>800 degrees </b>fahrenheit to <b>-300 degrees</b>. This extreme change in temperature 
                    occurs because the planet has little to no atmosphere, so it cannot 
                    retain much of the heat from the sun. Because of this, the side of 
                    the planet facing the sun receives all the heat from the sun while the 
                    side facing away from the sun loses all the heat. <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly enough, 
                    it is not the hottest planet in our solar system. This planet does not 
                    have any moons orbiting it. Also, the time on mercury is greatly different
                    from that of earths, a year on mercury would last up to 88 earth days. 
                    Mercury is also the second densest planet in our solar system, second only 
                    to earth. This planet also suffers greatly from the solar winds coming from
                    the sun. It is believed that it may be impossible for this planet to host life

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name Mercury comes from one of the 
                    roman messenger gods Mercurius. This planet has a very strange orbit around the sun, 
                    there are certain points where its closer to the sun and other points where is 
                    farther away from the sun. When it gets close to the sun during its orbit, its 
                    distance to the sun is around 20 million miles. When it gets its farthest point 
                    from the sun, Mercury is about 45 million miles away. It was once believed that 
                    Mercury was tidal locked, meaning that one side of the planet was always 
                    facing the sun. However, after recent studies, it was concluded that mercury 
                    was very slowly rotating.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists now believe that mercury has a molten core. 
                    This was the conclusion that they made after sending a satellite that they nicknamed Mariner 
                    10 to the planet.This satellite made close observations such as discovering that Mercury had 
                    a very weak magnetic field. It is believed that magnetic fields are associated with molten cores 
                    in planets <br><br>

                The is what humans expect Mercury would look like
                on the surface, the sun would look 3 times larger than
                what we see on earth, and the surface would be completely
                barren and completely damaged from meteorites and the strong 
                solar wind coming from the sun. The sky is expected to be
                black with stars.
